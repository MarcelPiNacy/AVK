# AVK
 A (WIP) sorting algorithm visualizer written in C++17 and Vulkan.  
 To add new algorithms to the visualizer you must create a new .CPP file inside the folder avk/algorithms. The file name must be the same as the sort's entry point. You must also add it as a menu item in the win32 resource file avk\internal\windows-specific\array_vk.rc to be able to run it from the GUI.
