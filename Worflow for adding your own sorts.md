- Each sort must reside in its own .CPP source file.
- All sort source files must be in the folder "avk\algorithms\\".
- The sort must have the following function signature:
```cpp
void my_sort_name(main_array array);
```
- The name of the source file and the sort's function must be the same.
- Remember to `#include "all.h"`
